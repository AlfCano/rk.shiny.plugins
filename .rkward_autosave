# rk.shiny.plugins

## RKWard Shiny Plugins Package and Generator

## Synopsis

This repository contains a single R script, `make_rk_shiny.R`, designed to programmatically generate a complete RKWard plugin package using the `rkwarddev` R package.

The resulting R package, `rk.shiny.plugins`, bundles several interactive data visualization and analysis tools (Shiny apps and HTML widgets) into a single, easy-to-install RKWard extension. The entire development process is encapsulated within the R script, making it reproducible, easy to maintain, and simple to extend with new plugins.

## Features

*   **Programmatic Generation**: The entire plugin structure, including all `.xml`, `.js`, and help files, is generated from a single R script. There is no need to manually edit XML or other plugin files.
*   **Single, Unified Package**: All interactive plugins are bundled into one package for easy distribution and installation.
*   **Extensible by Design**: The component-based architecture makes it straightforward to add new interactive plugins to the package by simply defining a new component in the script.
*   **Best Practices Included**: The generation script follows the best practices discovered through extensive testing, including the correct syntax for your version of `rkwarddev` and a robust structure for the help files and JavaScript logic.

## Plugins Included

This package currently generates the following three plugins, all accessible from the "Shiny" menu in RKWard:

### 1. rpivotTable

*   **Description**: Creates a powerful and interactive drag-and-drop pivot table, similar to those found in spreadsheet software. Ideal for quick data exploration and summarization.
*   **Depends on**: `rpivotTable` R package.
*   **Features**: Includes an option to save the generated pivot table widget to an object in the R environment.

### 2. ggplot GUI

*   **Description**: Launches the `ggplot_shiny()` interactive interface from the `ggplotgui` package. This provides a "point-and-click" graphical user interface for building complex `ggplot2` graphics.
*   **Depends on**: `ggplotgui` R package.

### 3. ggquickeda

*   **Description**: Launches the `run_ggquickeda()` interactive interface from the `ggquickeda` package. This provides a comprehensive Shiny gadget for exploratory data analysis.
*   **Depends on**: `ggquickeda` R package.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to generate, compile, and install the complete plugin package.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have R, RKWard, and the necessary R packages installed. You can install all required R packages by running this command in your R console:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c( "devtools", "rpivotTable", "ggplotgui", "ggquickeda"))
```

### Installation


If you have installed the add-on  (`RKWard >= 0.7.4`) 


Run the next command in your R console:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
local({
## Preparar
require(devtools)
## Computar
  install_github(
    repo="AlfCano/rk.shiny.plugins"
  )
## Imprimir el resultado
rk.header ("Results of installing from git")
})
```


### Generator
To run the generator `rkwarddev` package is needed.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rkwarddev")
```
